// For each of these types, do the following:
// Make at least two examples for each type
// Make one a declaration only
// Declare and initialize the other
// Once you have your variables, go ahead and print some of these values to the console.

// Concatenate two string variables. If you don't remember how to do that,
//check the Microsoft Docs here (Links to an external site.).
// Next, try to concatenate a number with a string as well and see what happens.
// Finally, print the results to the console.

//Create an  variable to hold a year.
//ask the user to enter a string value that represents a year (whole number)
