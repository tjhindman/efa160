using System.Collections.Generic;
using Classes;
//Classes

//Main component of our program
// When you define a class you will define the members that it holds

//todo: This is just a definition, its not the REAL data!
//todo: IT'S JUST A BLUEPRINT

//Ex: building a house , we'll know the features that it has After its build

//lets make a donut
Donut doug = new Donut();
Console.WriteLine(doug);

//our first class:
namespace Classes
{
    class Donut
    {

    }
}
